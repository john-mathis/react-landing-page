## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


## What I Learned
 
This was my first project that I created in React! Although there is no JS, I learned how to structure React Apps and import/export the various components!


### Continued development


I will continue to try and create the most effcient code possible. Using a mobile first workflow can cause me to overlook some aspects of the larger layouts, but I will continue to get better at this.
